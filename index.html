        <h2>Driven by Passion. Proven by Experience.</h2>
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>At NJS Automotive, we know a vehicle is more than just a way to get from point A to point B—it’s a symbol of
            hard work, cherished memories, and future possibilities. That’s why we treat every car like it’s our own.
        </p>
        <p>What sets us apart isn’t just our 10+ years of industry experience but the heart we bring to every job.
            We turned a love for vehicles into a business built on trust, precision, and care.
            While NJS is new, the experience behind it isn’t.
            Our founder spent over 10 years working with one of the biggest names in the automotive industry, managing
            operations and ensuring vehicles met the highest standards.
            Now, we’re bringing that same dedication, precision, and professionalism to vehicle logistics—giving you a
            service you can trust.</p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>To move what matters most to you—safely, on time, and with total transparency.</p>
        <p>Your vehicle is your pride and joy, and we treat it that way.
            Our mission is simple: make the logistics process seamless and stress-free.
            By combining a deep passion for cars with decades of expertise, we ensure every transport is handled with
            care, precision, and the professionalism you deserve.</p>
        <h3>Why We’re Different</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expert Hands, Every Step of the Way:</strong> With over 15 years of automotive experience, we
                bring unmatched precision and respect to every vehicle we move.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> From pick-up to drop-off, you’re never left guessing. We are
                always on hand to provide regular updates, so you always know where your vehicle is.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer-Centric Approach:</strong> Your needs aren’t just a priority—they’re our focus. From
                the first call to the final delivery, we aim to exceed expectations every time.</li>
