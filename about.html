        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At NJS Automotive, we know a vehicle is more than just a way to get from point A to point B—it’s a symbol of hard work, cherished memories, and future possibilities. That’s why we treat every car like it’s our own.</p>
        <p>What sets us apart isn’t just our 15+ years of industry experience but the heart we bring to every job. Our founder, a veteran in the automotive world, turned a love for vehicles into a business built on trust, precision, and care. While NJS is new, the experience behind it isn’t. Our founder spent over 15 years working with one of the biggest names in the automotive industry, managing operations and ensuring vehicles met the highest standards. Now, we’re bringing that same dedication, precision, and professionalism to vehicle logistics—giving you a service you can trust.</p>
